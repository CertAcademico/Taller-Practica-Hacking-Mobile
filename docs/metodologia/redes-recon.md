    Run a scan against an IP range to identify SMB signing and OS versions.
    Use valid credentials to test for local admin privileges across the subnet.
    Execute post-exploitation modules like dumping secrets or listing shares.

🛡️ Security Note

NetExec is loud and generates many failed login attempts if credentials are wrong; it will likely trigger an SOC alert.

📋 Overview

Hubble is a fully distributed networking and security observability platform for Kubernetes. Built on top of Cilium and eBPF, it provides deep visibility into how services communicate.
🎯 Tactical Applicability

    Primary Hacking Stage: Defensive Monitoring
    MITRE ATT&CK Phase: Network Effects (TA0040)
    Target Environment: Kubernetes

⚙️ Product Information

    Developer/Owner: cilium
    GitHub Repository: https://github.com/cilium/hubble
    Popularity: 4,164 stars

🚀 Quick Start (Installation & Run)

cilium hubble enable
hubble observe

📖 Simple Usage Guide

    Enable Hubble within an existing Cilium installation.
    Use the hubble observe command to see real-time flow data between pods.
    Utilize the Hubble UI to visualize the service map and identify blocked connections.

🛡️ Security Note

Hubble provides high-resolution data; ensure access to the Hubble API is restricted to authorized personnel.
IVRE
📋 Overview

IVRE is a powerful network reconnaissance framework that allows users to build their own "private Shodan." It integrates tools like Nmap, Masscan, and Zeek to collect and analyze network intelligence.
🎯 Tactical Applicability

    Primary Hacking Stage: Large-scale Recon / EASM
    MITRE ATT&CK Phase: Reconnaissance (TA0043)
    Target Environment: Internet-wide or Enterprise Networks

⚙️ Product Information

    Developer/Owner: ivre
    GitHub Repository: https://github.com/ivre/ivre
    Popularity: 4,004 stars

🚀 Quick Start (Installation & Run)

# Using Docker Compose for a quick setup
docker-compose up -d

📖 Simple Usage Guide

    Import your Nmap or Masscan results into the IVRE database.
    Use the web interface to search and filter discovered services across your infrastructure.
    Perform "Passive DNS" analysis to track changes in your network footprint over time.

🛡️ Security Note

Hosting a private Shodan-like database requires significant compute and storage resources; monitor your scanning activities to avoid ISP blacklisting.
